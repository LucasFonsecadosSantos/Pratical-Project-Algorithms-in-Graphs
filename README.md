# PRATICAL PROJECT OF DESIGN ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS
###### Depth First Search, Topological Ordering and Bellman Ford Algorithms Implementation.

## About this project
This is the pratical project of Design Analysis of Algorithm discipline from Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), developed by Lucas Fonseca dos Santos and Marco Aurelio Ferreira de Sousa that implements the Depth first search DFS, topological ordering, bellman ford algorithms and a Graph data structure.
It's able to receives a input data file and processing the operations listed there.

## Geting Started
coming soon

## System Requirements
- Shell Bash
- Java Virtual Machine

## How to use
In first step, enter the directory:
```
$ cd Pratical-Project-Algorithms-in-Graph/
```
Continuing then

```
$ sudo chmod +x init.sh
$ ./init.sh <input_file_path>
```

## Input File Formalism
The input data file follows the following formalism:

```
<identifier>:
X1
.
.
.
Xn
```

where (x1,...,xn) are arguments.
The possible identifiers are:

```
Vertexes:
Searchs:
Shortests:
Edges:
```

The vertexes, searchs and shortests set can be represented by any way, as:

```
Vertexes:
A
InitialVertex
1
001
```
But the edges set, follows the next formalism:

```
x0->xk(n)
```

Where x0 is u, xk is v and n is weight value, for u,v âˆˆ E.
